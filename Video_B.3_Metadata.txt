Video B.3 Coral larval settlement across the case study site from Ningaloo Reef in response to the assigned 
attractiveness of different substrate types, the natural reef substrate configuration and four different 
hydrodynamic conditions: (a) unidirectional flow, (b) oscillating flow, (c) cyclonic eddy, (d) no hydrodynamics. 
Settled coral larvae are shown in red and unsettled larvae in black.
