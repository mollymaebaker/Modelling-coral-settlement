Video B.2 Coral larval settlement in five example scenarios from the 28 scenarios simulated with the model. 
The left panel shows the spatial distribution of coral settlers (red) and unsettled coral larvae (black) within the 
10 x 10 m reef area for one replicate of each scenario. Box plots show the density of coral larvae that settled on 
substrates with differing attractiveness in the reef area at the end of each simulation for five replicates of each 
scenario. * indicates a significant difference in the density of coral settlers on substrates with a low, medium, 
and high attractiveness for settlement (Table A.2).
